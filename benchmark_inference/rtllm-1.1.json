The zero output is set to '1' when the result is all zeros, and '0' otherwise.\nInside the always block, a case statement is used to perform the appropriate operation based on the control signal (aluc). The result is assigned to the register (res) accordingly. For shift operations (SLL, SRL, SRA, SLLV, SRLV, SRAV), the shift amount is determined by the value of 'a' or 'a[4:0]'. For the LUI operation, the upper 16 bits of 'a' are concatenated with 16 zeros to form the result.\nIf the control signal (aluc) does not match any defined operation, the result is assigned as 'z' (high-impedance).\n\nGive me the complete code.\n", "Input": "module alu(\n    input [31:0] a,\n    input [31:0] b,\n    input [5:0] aluc,\n    output [31:0] r,\n    output zero,\n    output carry,\n    output negative,\n    output overflow,\n    output flag\n    );\n    parameter ADD = 6'b100000;\n    parameter ADDU = 6'b100001;\n    parameter SUB = 6'b100010;\n    parameter SUBU = 6'b100011;\n    parameter AND = 6'b100100;\n    parameter OR = 6'b100101;\n    parameter XOR = 6'b100110;\n    parameter NOR = 6'b100111;\n    parameter SLT = 6'b101010;\n    parameter SLTU = 6'b101011;\n    parameter SLL = 6'b000000;\n    parameter SRL = 6'b000010;\n    parameter SRA = 6'b000011;\n    parameter SLLV = 6'b000100;\n    parameter SRLV = 6'b000110;\n    parameter SRAV = 6'b000111;\n    parameter LUI = 6'b001111;"}

When the pedestrian button is pressed, if the remaining green time is greater than 10 clocks, it is shortened to 10 clocks, and if it is less than 10 clocks, it remains unchanged.
