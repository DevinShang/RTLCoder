# RTL-Coder: Outperforming GPT-3.5 in RTL Code Generation with Our Fully Open-Source Dataset and Lightweight Solution
We are still actively further improving and validating RTLCoder. This is version V1.0. If you are interested, please kindly monitor our latest update on Arxiv and Github repo in the near future.

RTLCoder-Z-v1.0 is based on Zephyr-7b-beta and finetuned on our collected dataset. The 4bit version RTLCoder-Z-GPTQ4bit-v1.0 is obtained by using GPTQ method. You can find the two models here: [RTLCoder-Z-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/ishorn5/RTLCoder-Z-v1.0), [RTLCoder-Z-GPTQ4bit-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/ishorn5/RTLCoder-Z-GPTQ4bit-v1.0)

We also provide the test results of RTLCoder-Z-v1.0 on two benchmarks: VerilogEval and RTLLM-v1.0 in the results folder.
